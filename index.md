* Lab 7
    Part 2
    Lab 7 in general was one of my favorite because of how we had to design the cards to work with each other 
    a few time during this project I thought I had come up with ideas in order to make the coding shorter that worked in the short end but no in the long run. This lab was a really good learning experience for me as I came to realize that lots of code, even if it makes sense, might bash or have unseen consequences in later code. For example for example I made all the numbered cards greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10 but that later had an issue with the face cards. 

  Lab 5 
   Part 1
   In lab 5 part one we were working with rectangles in order to find their area. This lab was fun for me as the work with numbers is very quantitative and easy to understand. This lab is also where I imporved many of my skills and refined what we were doing at the time. It also gave me a better understadning of the if else statements and the usage of absolute numbers in coding. Although this porject was surface level regarding math content, I think its fascinating that we can solve complex problems much easier with the help of coding and computers. 

   Lab 7 
    Part 1 
    Lab 7 part 1 was about parking signs and if you were allowed to park on this areas at cetrain times on certain days. I will admit this code was a bit frustrating especially when it came to the minutes in the hour as before that last sign we had only used hours which made it significantly easier. In the end this code made me feel acomplished in what my group and I had completed.

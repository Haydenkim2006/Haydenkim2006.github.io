### CPSC 120

* Lab 7
    Part 2
    Lab 7 in general was one of my favorite because of how we had to design the cards to work with each other 
    a few time during this project I thought I had come up with ideas in order to make the coding shorter that worked in the short end but no in the long run. This lab was a really good learning experience for me as I came to realize that lots of code, even if it makes sense, might bash or have unseen consequences in later code. For example for example I made all the numbered cards greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10 but that later had an issue with the face cards.
